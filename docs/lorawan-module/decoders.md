LoRaWAN devices send data in either a hex or base64 encoded format, which is not meaningful without further processing.
SiteSync allows for messages of any sensor type to be processed, decoded, and written to Ignition Tags via SiteSync's JavaScript engine.

## Requirements for JavaScript Decoders
- **Method Signature:** SiteSync expects every decoder to contain a function named `Decoder(bytes, port)`.
  - `bytes`: raw data generated by a LoRaWAN sensor as an array of bytes
  - `fport`: is the frame port number, represented as an integer, where the message was received
- Other helper functions included in the decoder file can be called by the main decoder method,
ut, the `Decoder` function will always act as the main function.
- **Return Value:** The decoder must return an **object** that represents the desired tag structure of the UDT.

## Custom Decoder Example

```javascript
/**
* Custom decoder function for decoding data.
* @param bytes - The payload data to be decoded (an array of bytes).
* @param port - The port number used during decoding.
* @returns {string} - The decoded result as a string.
*/
function Decoder(bytes, fport) {
  // Your decoding logic here
  let decodedResult = {}; //empty object that holds all UDT tag values
  decodedResult.Measurement = bytes[0]
  decodedResult.BatteryLevel = bytes[1]
  decodedResult.Temperature = bytes[2]
  return decodedResult;
}
```
