SiteSync can be run as a native mobile app, through Ignition's Perspective mobile app. This enables people to sync LoRaWAN devices from their phone.
The following are instructions on how to install the Perspective app.

The Perspective app can be downloaded from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ignition-perspective/id1430340904) or the [Google Play Store]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inductiveautomation.perspectiveapp&hl=en_US&pli=1)


Once installed,  you will hit "Add Gateway" and enter the address of your running Ignition gateway.

From there, you will see a list of Perspective applications, select the installed SiteSync project, and start syncing.
